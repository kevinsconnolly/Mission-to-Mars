# Mission-to-Mars


For the Mission to Mars, I automated a web browser to visit different NASA/MARS websites to extract data about the Mission to Mars. We stored it in a NoSQL database, and then supply the data in a web application created with Flask.
## Resources 
- **Data Source:** [NASA news](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/?page=0&per_page=40&order=publish_date+desc%2Ccreated_at+desc&search=&category=19%2C165%2C184%2C204&blank_scope=Latest) website, [Mars Hemispheres](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) website, [getbootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/) website 
- **Software:** Jupyter notebook, BeautifulSoup, Splinter, MongoDB, Flask & Python

 
  
## Objectives
- Used HTML elements, as well as class and id attributes, to identify content for web scraping.
- Automated a web browser and performed web scraping via BeautifulSoup and Splinter.
- Created an HTML/CSS portfolio in order to present my data and projects.
- Used Bootstrap to customize and update the information.
- Created a MongoDB database to store data from the web scrape and used Flask to display the data

## Challenge Overview
For the challenge, I scraped  content in order to updated the previous data for the web application. I added more images to the application.


## Objectives (in order)
- Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter in order for the web browser to be automated and scrape high resolution images.
- MongoDB database used in order to store data from the web scrape. 
- Updated the web application and Flask to display key pieces of data from the web scrape.
- Bootstrap incorporated in order to style the web application
