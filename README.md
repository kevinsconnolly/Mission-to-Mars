</p>  

In this module, we automated a web browser to visit different websites to extract data about the Mission to Mars. We stored it in a NoSQL database, and then render the data in a web application created with Flask. The completed work is displayed in our portfolio, which we also created.  

## Resources 
- **Data Source:** [NASA news](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/?page=0&per_page=40&order=publish_date+desc%2Ccreated_at+desc&search=&category=19%2C165%2C184%2C204&blank_scope=Latest) website, [Mars Hemispheres](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) website, [getbootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/) website 
- **Software:** BeautifulSoup, Splinter, MongoDB, Flask, Python, Jupyter notebook

## Objectives
By the end of this module, we will be able to: 
- Gain familiarity with and use HTML elements, as well as class and id attributes, to identify content for web scraping.
- Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a web browser and perform a web scrape.
- Create a MongoDB database to store data from the web scrape.
- Create a web application with Flask to display the data from the web scrape.
- Create an HTML/CSS portfolio to showcase projects.
- Use Bootstrap components to polish and customize the portfolio.

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, we will scrape additional content for the web app. This time, the focus is to add more images to the app.
